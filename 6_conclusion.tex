First pilot implementation of Learning Trail application at the new building in NUS for occupant comfort data collection has proven successful. Within just 3 months, 1163 data points of thermal, visual and aural comfort were obtained from the 616 participants, with minimal administrative overhead.\\

This rich data set provides new opportunities for analyzing occupant comfort behavior through data driven methods. Within this study, we've demonstrated how data can be used to group occupants and spaces based on comfort profile types. For the new building at NUS, we identified [INSERT NUMEBR HERE] distinct user types and [INSERT NUMEBR HERE] distinct space types.\\

As next steps this study provides the proof of concept for SpaceMatch - a spatial recommendation system - that utilizes the user types to match space profiles to the user comfort profiles in real time through an easy to use mobile application.
