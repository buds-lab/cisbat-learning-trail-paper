First pilot implementation of Learning Trail application at the new building in NUS for occupant comfort data collection has proven successful. Within just 3 months, 1163 data points of thermal, visual and aural comfort were obtained from [INSERT NUMBER] participants who gave 5 or more votes. A total of 616 participants have contributed to the study till date, with minimal administrative overhead.\\

This rich data set provides new opportunities for understanding occupant comfort behavior through data driven methods. Within this study, we've demonstrated how data can be used to group occupants into comfort profile types and shown this study as potential stepping stone to other research areas such as comfort profiling of spaces, occupant behavior analysis and correlation identification between various spatio-temporal variables in buildings.\\

As a logical next step, this study provides the proof of concept for SpaceMatch - a spatial recommendation system that utilizes the collected data from this study to match user comfort profiles to spaces that best suit them in real time.
