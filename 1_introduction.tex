Individual differences in comfort preferences describe the phenomenon that building occupants might perceive their thermal environment differently even when exposed to the same conditions. This means what suits one group or type of occupants may be unacceptable for others - making it challenging to provide comfortable, conditioned environments for everyone in the the same space.

Even though its understood that differences in individual comfort preferences exist \cite{WANG2018181}, their identification presents significant challenges for researchers and practitioners in field conditions. Structured surveys or interviews - on-line or off-line, in person or remote - are conventionally used to collect human comfort feedback for buildings. Though these approaches work in principle, they have a number of shortcomings \cite{organisationforeconomicco-operationanddevelopment(oecd)_2013}:  

\begin{itemize}
  \item Subjectivity: There is sufficient evidence to suggest variance in subjective well-being responses based on individual differences in respondent's personality, geographical background and culture \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145056}
  \item Response bias \& heuristics: A number of factors such as lack of motivation (respondents may not process questions fully), failures in communication (survey questions may be unclear or misunderstood) and lack of knowledge (respondents do not know the answer to a question, but answer it anyway) are often associated with increased risk of biases and respondent heuristics in survey responses \cite{bradburn2004asking}.
  \item Contextual cues: Subtle cues in the survey context influence how respondent answer questions \cite{krosnick1997seymour} - since most studies are conducted outside of the respondent's natural working environment - it might have unintended consequences on responses. 
  \item Scalability: Its difficult to collect large sample data sets due to the administrative, financial and other operational overheads of conventional approaches.
\end{itemize}


This paper presents SDE Learning Trail - a human-building interaction framework that enables building visitors and occupants to provide environmental comfort feedback in a simple and intuitive way - while helping them learn about the sustainability features of the new Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) building at the School of Design \& Environment (SDE), National University of Singapore (NUS). The framework was launched at the opening cermony of new building and has collected [INSERT NUMBER] responses till date.\\

This work also demonstrates how the collected data can used for construction of personalized comfort profiles of users and spatial profiles of rooms over time - which in turn provides the proof of concept for SpaceMatch - a spatial recommendation system - that integrates the comfort functionalities of "SDE Learning Trail" to match flexible workspaces with the comfort profile of users in real time.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the SDE Learning Trail framework and its deployment at NUS. Section 3 details a how the research team uses the application to collect occupant comfort feedback in the building. Section 4 presents the preliminary results from this deployment till date, and Section 5 discusses our findings and next steps in this project. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
