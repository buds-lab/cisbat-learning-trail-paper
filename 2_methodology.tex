The methodology runs the ASF Simulation. It will be briefly reviewed here for Simplicity 


\subsection{Solar Radiation Evaluation}
\label{ch:rad}



\subsection{Building Simulation Model}
\label{ch:sim}

\subsection{Sensitivities}

Within this framework, three sensitivities will be analysed:

\begin{description}

\item[Building Envelope:] The building envelope is characterised in the RC model as $H_w$. ...
\item[Infiltration:] The infiltration rate is modified in the $H_{ve}$ component of the RC model...
\item[Thermal Capacitance:] The thermal capacitance of the mass is denoted as $C_m$ in the RC model. It...

\end{description}


\subsection{Analysis of Archetypes}

- Building Archetypes are taken from CEA tool and evaluated within the ASF Framework

- Table of Input Parameters for the different buildings
